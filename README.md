# React Chat Log
In this project you will use core React concepts to build a chat messenger-style application which displays a log of chat messages between two people, using static data from a JSON file. We will build user interaction with a like feature and a color choosing feature. 

## Skills Assessed
- Building React components which recieve data through props
- Building React container components which pass information to their subcomponents
- Initializing and using state within a component
- Passing callback functions to child components and use them to update state
- Practice reading and running tests
- Using git as part of the development workflow
- Demonstrating understanding of the front-end layer, and the relationship between user interaction and the UI

## Project Outline
This project comes with a minimal scaffold based on the baseline React application generated by `create-react-app`. We provide the JSON file with static chat message data and the CSS styles, and you will need to implement all of the components except for the provided `Timestamp` component.
