# Wave 2

Implement a `ChatLog` component to extend the App from displaying a single chat message to an entire chat log. The focus here should be on creating a component that displays a sequence of individual `ChatEntry` components.

At this point you should be able to use the entire chat message data from the JSON file to test your code as you implement each component.

## props

`ChatLog` takes one prop named `chatMessages` (which is an array).
