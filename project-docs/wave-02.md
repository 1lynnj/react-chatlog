# Wave 2

In this wave you will extend from displaying a single chat message to an entire chat log. The focus here should be on creating component(s) that can display a sequence of individual chat message components.

At this point you should be able to use the entire chat message data from the JSON file to test your code as you implement each component.

## Tests

The tests as written for this component assume that the component is named `ChatLog` and takes one prop named `chatMessages` (which is an array).
